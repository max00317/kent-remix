problemStatements:
  part1:
    Over half the world's population (~5 billion people) are on the internet
  part2: Using the web effectively is how you reach them
  part3: >-
    Building web applications includes a lot of interesting and challenging
    problems. Libraries and frameworks are necessary in helping you develop the
    kinds of experiences users of web applications expect, but they can also
    **hide the core primitives** of the web platform from you which leads you to
    make **poor decisions**.
  part4: >-
    In this workshop, we'll continue our work on [Web App Fundamentals (Part
    1)](web-app-fundamentals-part-1), and work in a _real-world application_
    that is taking advantage of a framework. But we'll do so through the lense
    of the web platform primitives that each feature is built upon to ensure
    we're taking **full advantage of the platform**.
keyTakeaways:
  - title: Use JavaScript to enhance the experience, not enable it
    description:
      JavaScript can add a lot of value to your web application, but it's
      important to use it wisely. In this workshop, you'll learn how to **use
      JavaScript to enhance** the user experience, rather than relying on it to
      enable core functionality. This will make your application more accessible
      and maintainable in the long run. We're going to make JavaScript pay for
      it's weight.
  - title: Gracefully handling errors leads to happier users
    description:
      No web application is perfect, and errors are inevitable. However, how you
      handle errors can make a big difference in the user experience. In this
      workshop, you'll learn how to gracefully handle errors and provide helpful
      feedback to users (and search engines), which can **improve their
      satisfaction** with your application.
  - title: Take advantage of the browser's built-in form validation
    description:
      No matter what we do, we need to validate user input on the server. So
      we'll learn how to do that, but we'll also learn how to use the built-in
      form validations modern browsers provide that can help you **create more
      user-friendly forms**.
  - title: Care about people, and don't get sued
    description: >-
      Accessibility is an important consideration for any web application. In
      this workshop, you'll learn about the basics of web accessibility and how
      to ensure that your application is accessible to as many people as
      possible. It's the **decent human** thing to do, but it also helps you
      **avoid getting sued**.
topics:
  - Scripting (Pending UI and prefetching)
  - Error Handling
  - Form Validation
  - Accessibility
prerequisite: >-
  You should have experience with [these JavaScript
  features](/blog/javascript-to-know-for-react) and attend my [React Hooks
  Workshop](/workshops/react-hooks) or have the equivalent experience. This
  workshop will use TypeScript, but should be completable if you do not have
  experience with TypeScript.
