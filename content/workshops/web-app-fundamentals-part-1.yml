problemStatements:
  part1: The web is a powerful tool for building applications
  part2: And too many web developers don't know how to use it
  part3: >-
    Since the beginning, the web platform has had primitives for building
    applications that can reach the increasing number of people on the planet
    with an internet connection. Tools exist to help you do this, but a lack of
    understanding in the web primitives they're built upon has led many web
    developers to build applications that are **slow**, **inaccessible**, and
    **difficult to maintain**.
  part4: >-
    Understanding the **foundational primitives** of the web will make you a
    better web developer, _regardless of the tools you use_. In this workshop
    we'll be working in a _real-world_ application that uses a framework, but do
    so through the lense of the web platform primitives to make sure we're
    taking **full advantage of the web**. And then we'll come back in [Web App
    Fundamentals (Part 2)](web-app-fundamentals-part-2) to take it even further.
keyTakeaways:
  - title: Load CSS and use modern authoring techniques
    description:
      Learn how to optimize your web application's styling by loading CSS
      efficiently and using modern authoring techniques that can **save you and
      your team time** and effort in the long run.
  - title: Take full advantage of the power of the URL
    description:
      The URL is a powerful tool for building web applications. It's one of the
      super-powers of the web that other platforms don't have. In this workshop,
      you'll learn how to use it effectively to improve both the user experience
      as well as the developer experience and the **usability** of your web
      application.
  - title: Load your data efficiently
    description:
      One of the keys to building a high-quality web application is loading your
      data efficiently. In this workshop, you'll learn how to **optimize your
      data loading**, including using platform standard caching techniques.
  - title: Use simple forms to build complex interactions
    description:
      Forms are a key component of most web applications, and in this workshop,
      you'll learn the **fundamental technology** of the web for enabling your
      users to perform data mutations. Just because your application allows
      complex user interactions doesn't mean your code for managing that has to
      be complex. And if you embrace the web platform, it doesn't have to be.
  - title: Optimize your application for search engines and social media
    description:
      Websites live and die by their findability and shareability. It's more
      important than ever to optimize your web application for search engines
      and social media. In this workshop, you'll learn about Search Engine
      Optimization techniques and how to **make your application more
      shareable** on social media.
