  part1: The web is the doorway to the world
  part2: Understanding it at a deep level is critical to building on it
  part3: >-
    There are over five billion people connected to the internet. Whether you're
    building an online presence for your business, a personal blog, an ecommerce
    site, or anything in between, having a solid understanding of the
    fundamentals of the web is critical to creating the kind of user experience
    software developers expect.
  part4: >-
    Most people getting into web development in recent years naturally breeze
    through (or plain skip over) web fundamentals in their pursuit of their
    first dev job. Unfortunately, this results in the substandard reinvention of
    wheels which means lots of work for sub-optimal results. Frustrated devs.
    Frustrated customers. In this workshop we're diving deep into important bits
    of the web platform you need to be successful building web applications.
keyTakeaways:
  - title: Understand HTTP
    description:
      Your web app starts with the HTTP request/response cycle. We'll look at
      this in depth from both the browser and server perspective. In particular
      through the lense of the Web Fetch standard.
  - title: Implement efficient caching
    description:
      Not just assets, but any resource accessed via HTTP can be cached via
      proper use of `Cache-Control` header directives. We'll learn how to take
      advantage of these directives for in-browser caching as well as shared
      caching on a CDN.
  - title: Speed up your site with prefetching
    description:
      Eliminate pending states by taking advantage of the platform's `<link>`
      tag for preloading and prefetching resources and even preconnecting to
      other domains to easily speed up your app.
  - title: Explain how links and forms work
    description:
      If you joined the web dev industry in recent years, you were probably
      taught that your `onSubmit` handler for a form should start with the line
      `event.preventDefault()`. We're going to get you to the point that you
      understand what the browser actually does if you don't prevent this
      behavior. You'll also understand important browser behavior regarding
      links and what happens when the user changes their mind.
  - title: Use Semantic HTML
    description:
      HTML is a relatively simple markup language that includes a great deal of
      built-in capabilities. Just like any tool, it works best when you hold it
      right, and using semantic HTML is how you ensure the browser can do it's
      job with your app. We'll also briefly talk about the role of CSS
      (Cascading Style Sheets) has in this.

prerequisite: >-
  This is __not__ an introduction to programming course. You should have *some*
  experience with coding. You will be expected to have and be comfortable with a
  coding editor. You will need to have modern versions of git, npm, and Node.js
  installed on your computer. It will be guided and appropriate for beginners
  looking to get a better understanding of the web platform as well as
  experienced developers who want to level-up with a deep dive of the web
  platform.
