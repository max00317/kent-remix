I live stream on [my YouTube channel](https://kcd.im/YouTube) because it's an
easy place to stream to and keep the video around for posterity without any
extra effort. I stream whatever I'm working on (right now that's content and
projects for [EpicWeb.dev](https://epicweb.dev)).

Due to moderation issues on the YouTube platform, I ignore live chat on YouTube.
If you want to participate in chat, please join
[#ðŸ’»-livestream-chat](https://kcd.im/discord-livestream-chat) on
[discord](https://kcd.im/discord).

With the exception of [Office Hours](/office-hours), my live streams aren't
typically very interactive. I do talk though my thought process so they're
entertaining to observe and when I get stuck or during breaks I often will check
back on the chat. But the point is for me to be productive, not to answer
questions (that's what Office Hours is for!).

ðŸ“… I often stream without scheduling it, but I do have my live stream schedule
and you can
[subscribe to the Google Calendar](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/u/0?cid=Y19wNWdyaTl1bHVtNWw3MDBpZHFmcmw3c210Y0Bncm91cC5jYWxlbmRhci5nb29nbGUuY29t)
where I schedule it.
