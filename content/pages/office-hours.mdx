# KCD Office Hours

Once a week, Kent is available for an hour to answer any questions you have.
This is especially helpful for [KCD Learning Clubs](/clubs) but everyone is
invited. Office hours is held on Zoom (you need to be logged into your Zoom
account to join).

Office Hours are held weekly on Fridays at
[9:30-10:30 AM Mountain Time](<https://www.thetimezoneconverter.com/?t=9%3A30%20am&tz=Mountain%20Time%20(MT)&>).

I also live stream it to [my YouTube Channel](https://kcd.im/youtube) where
you'll find recordings of previous office hours.

Office hours is a [KCD Community Meetup](/meetups). To be notified when office
hours begins, go to
[`#‚è±-upcoming-meetups`](https://kcd.im/discord-upcoming-meetups) and add your
`‚úã` reaction to
[the Office Hours scheduled meetup message](https://discord.com/channels/715220730605731931/801954718984175657/812227697710727198).

## Join

To join, simply join the [KCD Discord](/discord) community, and jump in the
[`#üè´-kcd-office-hours`](https://kcd.im/discord-office-hours) channel to ask
questions and get the links that I share with my responses.

When the meeting begins, join the Zoom meeting using this link:
[kcd.im/office-hours-zoom](https://kcd.im/office-hours-zoom).

I often answer questions posted in the Discord channel, but people who are
actually _in_ the Zoom call get priority.

## Schedule

You can find my schedule for office hours on my live streaming calendar which
you can find on [/live](/live).
