TL;DR, I'm undertaking [a new adventure](/blog/i-m-building-epicweb-dev)
requiring all of my time, so I'm leaving the Remix team to focus on that new
endeavor. I'm not leaving the Remix community though! I'm still very much
committed to what Remix is doing and excited about its future. My new adventure
(EpicWeb.dev) definitely includes Remix in a big way.

I'd like to take some time to review the last 10 months or so of my career. Read
on if you're interested to know what exactly it was that I did while at Remix.

My personal (career) [mission statement](/transparency#mission) is summarized on
[my homepage](/):

> Helping people make the world a better place through quality software.

When [I joined Remix](/blog/how-i-help-you-build-better-websites), my goal was
to push that forward by helping to create a community for what I see as the
framework that's leading the charge in the way we'll be building web
applications in the future.

<callout-info class="aside">
  I developed this conviction after [rebuilding my website in
  Remix](/blog/how-i-built-a-modern-website-in-2021) and it's evidenced by the
  fact that many modern frameworks are trying to adopt the great ideas pioneered
  by Remix.
</callout-info>

The results of my efforts have been huge. I don't pretend to be solely
responsible for this, but most of what the Remix community is so far has been
intentionally built. Remix now has a strong community of helpful, friendly
members who are trying to make the web a better place for users and developers.
No web framework in the history of the web has grown as quickly as Remix, even
if you _do_ factor in year that Remix was _paid_ licensed software. Some
specific community/growth-related numbers/stats include:

- 13k members on [the (very active) Remix Discord](https://rmx.as/discord).
- 2.4k members on [Meetup.com](https://rmx.as/meetup) with 12 groups in 10
  countries.
- [The inaugural Remix Conf in May](https://remix.run/conf/2022) (only 6 months
  after open sourcing!!) had over 300 attendees and 31 sponsors (sold out). The
  workshop had 80 attendees and there were over 80 people on the waiting list.
  (Also,
  [next year is scheduled for May 9-11th 2023](https://remix.run/conf/2023) and
  tickets/sponsorships are already selling).
- [429 contributors on GitHub](https://github.com/remix-run/remix/graphs/contributors)
- Used by
  [12.5k (public) projects on GitHub](https://github.com/remix-run/remix/network/dependents?package_id=UGFja2FnZS0yOTI1ODU4MDcz).
- 8.4k downloads of the 12 episodes of
  [the Remix Podcast](https://remix.transistor.fm/).
- 2.7 million views by 673.6k people of [the Remix website](https://remix.run).
- Remix won the
  ["Breakthrough of the year" award](https://twitter.com/ReactSummit/status/1539644608417783808)
  at React Summit 2022.
- 10.3k subscribers of
  [the Remix YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/c/Remix-Run) with 426.3k
  views (and 52.8k hours of time watched ðŸ¤¯).
- 19.4k subscribers of [the Remix Newsletter](https://remix.run/newsletter).
- 42.7k followers of [@remix_run on Twitter](https://twitter.com/remix_run).
- 74k weekly downloads of
  [`@remix-run/server-runtime`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@remix-run/server-runtime).

Actual adoption is tough to measure, but there are definitely thousands of
companies at this point adopting Remix in both "greenfield" as well as migratory
projects. And you definitely would recognize the names of many of them. I don't
know which companies I'm allowed to talk about using Remix, but let's just say
one starts with "N" and ends with "etflix," another starts with "M" and ends
with "icrosoft," and another starts with "T" and ends with "esla" ðŸ˜†. There are
plenty more, but those I really don't think I am allowed to talk about yet ðŸ˜…

I've spent my time at Remix working on pushing all these quantitative metrics
and qualitative properties around adoption forward. Since joining Remix, I have
given
[my introductory talk](https://kentcdodds.com/talks/building-excellent-user-experiences-with-remix)
over 20 times (many to some of the aforementioned companies). I traveled to 6
conferences and gave talks about Remix all over the world (I have
[more coming up soon too](/talks)!). I also
[appeared on over 15 podcasts and interviews](/appearances) where I talked about
Remix.

As the "Director of Developer Experience" at Remix, I definitely directed a lot
of the DX while at Remix from a technical level as well. I played a primary role
in the development and design of the Remix CLI and
[the Stacks feature](https://remix.run/blog/remix-stacks). I sped up the test
runs of Remix itself by 2x. I created a nice playground environment for local
development of Remix itself. I built the Remix Discord bot. I pushed 113 commits
to the Remix repository, merged 485 PRs (mostly docs and examples), and
participated in countless discussions in the repo, discord, and on twitter.

As a Remix Cofounder, I also met every week with Ryan and Michael to talk about
the direction of the company and decide where we needed to focus our efforts and
that of our team.

As a new one for me, I also led other developers at Remix to implement fixes and
features we needed. I'm not much of a manager or team lead, but I'm happy to
report that none of them quit, so that's gotta count for something ðŸ˜…

I'm completely floored by these facts and figures. The trends are even more
exciting, but I've only got so much time to dedicate to this blog post, so we'll
just leave it where it is. Suffice it to say, people seem very excited about the
framework and for good reason.

I'm proud of what I accomplished while at Remix. I'm proud of the community
that's being created there. I'm excited about the future of Remix and the
direction that it's taking the web. I've never been so productive and that makes
me excited about the potential for all of us building user experiences on the
web.

Curious what's next for me? Read the companion blog post to this one:
