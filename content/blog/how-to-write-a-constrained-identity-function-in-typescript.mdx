In
[How to write a React Component in TypeScript](/blog/how-to-write-a-react-component-in-typescript),
I typed an example React component. Here's where we left off:

```tsx
const operations = {
  '+': (left: number, right: number): number => left + right,
  '-': (left: number, right: number): number => left - right,
  '*': (left: number, right: number): number => left * right,
  '/': (left: number, right: number): number => left / right,
}

type CalculatorProps = {
  left: number
  operator: keyof typeof operations
  right: number
}

function Calculator({left, operator, right}: CalculatorProps) {
  const result = operations[operator](left, right)
  return (
    <div>
      <code>
        {left} {operator} {right} = <output>{result}</output>
      </code>
    </div>
  )
}

const examples = (
  <>
    <Calculator left={1} operator="+" right={2} />
    <Calculator left={1} operator="-" right={2} />
    <Calculator left={1} operator="*" right={2} />
    <Calculator left={1} operator="/" right={2} />
  </>
)
```

I'm not satisfied with the `operations` function though. I know that _every_
function in that object is going to have the exact same type (by necessity due
to the use case):

```tsx
type OperationFn = (left: number, right: number) => number
```

The `operations` object is really just a record of operation strings mapped to a
function that operates on two numbers. So if we add a type annotation on our
`operations` variable, then we don't have to type each function individually.
Let's try that:

```tsx
type OperationFn = (left: number, right: number) => number
const operations: Record<string, OperationFn> = {
  '+': (left, right) => left + right,
  '-': (left, right) => left - right,
  '*': (left, right) => left * right,
  '/': (left, right) => left / right,
}

type CalculatorProps = {
  left: number
  operator: keyof typeof operations
  right: number
}
```

Sweet, so we don't have to type every function individually, but oh no... now
the `typeof operations` is `Record<string, OperationFn>` and the `keyof` of that
is going to be `string` which means our `CalculatorProps['operator']` type will
be `string`. Ugh ðŸ˜©

Here's what we could do to fix this:

```tsx [2-3]
type OperationFn = (left: number, right: number) => number
type Operator = '+' | '-' | '/' | '*'
const operations: Record<Operator, OperationFn> = {
  '+': (left, right) => left + right,
  '-': (left, right) => left - right,
  '*': (left, right) => left * right,
  '/': (left, right) => left / right,
}

type CalculatorProps = {
  left: number
  operator: keyof typeof operations
  right: number
}
```

But now we're back to having to add `**` in two places if we decide to add the
Exponentiation operator. However, in this case, TypeScript will give us a
compiler error if we add it in one and not the other, so that's a step up.

This is where I left this when I first wrote this component, but then
[@AlekseyL13 suggested](https://twitter.com/AlekseyL13/status/1368796045547888644)
that I try a properly typed identity function.

## The constrained identity function

First, let's keep in mind, we have 2 goals:

1. Enforce that the type of each property is the same (in this simple example,
   it's just a number, but in our actual example, it's a function type)
2. Ensure that `keyof typeof` for our object results in a finite union of the
   keys

<callout-success>
  TypeScript version 4.9.0 introduces `satisfies` which ... eh... satisfies our
  use cases here. Please feel free to [skip to the
  end](#typescript-490---satisfies) if you're using TypeScript v4.9.0 or
  greater.
</callout-success>

With TypeScript, it's a challenge to have both of these. By default, we get the
second goal. The problem is that when you try to accomplish the first goal with
a type annotation like `const operations: Record<string, OperationFn> = ...`,
you end up widening the `key` so `keyof typeof` results in `string`. Ugh, how
annoying.

So here's where the constrained identity function comes in. By the way,
"constrained" describes a situation where you have a function that accepts a
narrower version of an input than it's passed.Here's a simple example:

```tsx
type NamedObject = {name: string}
function getUserName<User extends NamedObject>(user: User) {
  return user.name
}

const obj = {name: 'Hannah', age: 3}
getUserName(obj)
```

So the object that's passed to `getUserName` must satisfy all the types in the
`NamedObject`. The `getUserName` constrains the input to at least match that
type.

And an "identity function" is a function that accepts a value and returns that
value. I sometimes use these kinds of functions as the default value for
callbacks:

```tsx [1]
const identity = <Type extends unknown>(item: Type) => item

type ModifyConfigFn = (config: ConfigType) => ConfigType
function buildProject(modifyConfig: ModifyConfigFn = identity) {
  const config: ConfigType = {
    /* some config */
  }
  const modifiedConfig = modifyConfig(config)
  // more stuff...
}
```

So with those definitions out of the way, a "constrained identity function" is a
function which returns what it is given and also helps TypeScript constrain its
type. This is exactly what we want to do.

We can call it a **CIF** (pronounced "see eye eff"). Sure, let's go with that.

Let me show you a simple example first, then I'll explain what's going on, then
we can apply it more usefully to our more complicated example:

```tsx
type Value = number
const createNumbers = <ObjectType extends Record<string, Value>>(
  obj: ObjectType,
) => obj

const numbers = createNumbers({one: 1, two: 2, three: 3, four: 4})

// @ts-expect-error we don't have 'five' yet
numbers['five']
```

So the `createNumbers` is the constrained identity function. It returns the
`obj` it's given, hopefully that's clear. But how does it enforce our input and
constrain the type?

Let me explain it this way. If we start with:

```tsx
const numbers = {one: 1, two: 2, three: 3, four: 4}
// typeof numbers:
// {
//   one: number;
//   two: number;
//   three: number;
//   four: number;
// }
```

But in the future, someone could come to this code and change it like this:

```tsx
const numbers = {one: 1, two: 2, three: 3, four: 4, five: '5'}
// typeof numbers:
// {
//   one: number;
//   two: number;
//   three: number;
//   four: number;
//   five: string; // ðŸ˜±
// }
```

Yikes! Nah, we can't have that! (And, more importantly, in our `Calculator`
example, some auto-typing on the functions is the goal here).

So, let's enforce our value types with a type annotation:

```tsx
// @ts-expect-error HA! We gotcha! No strings in this object!
const numbers: Record<string, number> = {
  one: 1,
  two: 2,
  three: 3,
  four: 4,
  five: '5',
}
```

But now by typing our values explicitly, we've told TypeScript that our `key`
can be a string. Unfortunately, there's no way to tell TypeScript: "This thing
has the keys it has, but the values are this specific type." IMO, this is a
missing feature of TypeScript. Our `createNumbers` constrained identity function
(er... "CIF") is a workaround.

So here's what that workaround is:

**Constrained identity functions allow us to _not_ explicitly annotate our
variable while _still_ getting to enforce the values.**

So we create the object, get the best type that TypeScript can offer us (which
includes the narrow keys and wide values), then we pass it to a function which
accepts wide keys and narrow values. TypeScript combines that to give us a
`Record` with a `key` and `value` which are both narrow!

Alrighty, so let's apply a CIF to our original situation:

```tsx
type OperationFn = (left: number, right: number) => number
const createOperations = <OperationsType extends Record<string, OperationFn>>(
  operations: OperationsType,
) => operations

const operations = createOperations({
  '+': (left, right) => left + right,
  '-': (left, right) => left - right,
  '*': (left, right) => left * right,
  '/': (left, right) => left / right,
})

type CalculatorProps = {
  left: number
  operator: keyof typeof operations
  right: number
}

// @ts-expect-error we haven't added support
// for the exponentiation operator yet
operations['**'](1, 2)
```

Wahoo! So with this solution we don't have to explicitly type all the operation
functions the exact same way and we can still get a union type of all available
operations.

## A generic CIF?

You may have noticed that we had two CIFs in the previous section:

```tsx
type Value = number
const createNumbers = <ObjectType extends Record<string, Value>>(
  obj: ObjectType,
) => obj

type OperationFn = (left: number, right: number) => number
const createOperations = <OperationsType extends Record<string, OperationFn>>(
  operations: OperationsType,
) => operations
```

Wouldn't it be neat if we could combine those? Sure would. But you're not going
to like it... Here's what I tried first:

```tsx
const constrain = <Given, Inferred extends Given>(item: Inferred) => item

// @ts-expect-error Expected 2 type arguments, but got 1.(2558)
const numbers = constrain<Record<string, number>>({one: 1 /* etc. */})
```

Sad day. Unfortunately this is just not possible with TypeScript today. But
here's a workaround:

```tsx
const constrain =
  <Given extends unknown>() =>
  <Inferred extends Given>(item: Inferred) =>
    item

const numbers = constrain<Record<string, number>>()({one: 1 /* etc. */})
```

... yeah, I told you you wouldn't like it. It's marginally better like this:

```tsx
const createNumbers = constrain<Record<string, number>>()
const numbers = createNumbers({one: 1 /* etc. */})
```

But like, huh. Bummer.

Luckily, I don't find myself making CIFs very often anyway and they aren't
difficult to write so I don't need an abstraction for them. Thought it'd be
interesting to share with you though ðŸ˜„

## TypeScript 4.9.0 - `satisfies`

With the `satisfies` keyword in TypeScript, you can avoid _all_ these issues
pretty easily:

```ts
type OperationFn = (left: number, right: number) => number

const operations = {
  '+': (left, right) => left + right,
  '-': (left, right) => left - right,
  '*': (left, right) => left * right,
  '/': (left, right) => left / right,
} satisfies Record<string, OperationFn>
```

This effectively does the same thing and has none of the drawbacks. Hooray for
progress!

## Conclusion

Here's the final version of our calculator component with everything typed with
our CIF:

```tsx [2-4]
type OperationFn = (left: number, right: number) => number
const createOperations = <OperationsType extends Record<string, OperationFn>>(
  opts: OperationsType,
) => opts

const operations = createOperations({
  '+': (left, right) => left + right,
  '-': (left, right) => left - right,
  '*': (left, right) => left * right,
  '/': (left, right) => left / right,
})

type CalculatorProps = {
  left: number
  operator: keyof typeof operations
  right: number
}
function Calculator({left, operator, right}: CalculatorProps) {
  const result = operations[operator](left, right)
  return (
    <div>
      <code>
        {left} {operator} {right} = <output>{result}</output>
      </code>
    </div>
  )
}

const examples = (
  <>
    <Calculator left={1} operator="+" right={2} />
    <Calculator left={1} operator="-" right={2} />
    <Calculator left={1} operator="*" right={2} />
    <Calculator left={1} operator="/" right={2} />
  </>
)
```

Yup, this entire blog post was written just to explain those 3 lines of code to
you. So yeah, there you go.

Some folks may finish reading this post and scoff, saying things like: "Why
would you ever want to use TypeScript if it requires you to do weird things like
this?"

First, I'd say that just because a tool like TypeScript requires workarounds for
some stuff like this doesn't mean it's not worthwhile. The cost here is minimal
and the benefit is significant. I'm not here to convince you to use TypeScript.
I can't do as good a job convincing you as your runtime bugs do I'm sure ðŸ˜œ
Secondly, this is definitely something that could improve with TypeScript in the
future. In fact,
[this may be a nice step to improving things](https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript/issues/26242).
Finally, like I said, this isn't something that we're doing all the time. Most
of my time with TypeScript is delightful.

Take care!
